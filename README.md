djangocms-markdown
==================

Forked from https://github.com/ovidner/djangocms-markdown

**Compared to ovidner's version, it adds Django migrations support to work smoothly with Django 1.7+**

This is a plugin for django-cms that aims to replace the standard text plugin
with it's WYSIWYG editors. With cmsplugin-markdown you can write your content
in Markdown using EpicEditor (http://oscargodson.github.com/EpicEditor/)

Installation
------------

Install from GitHub::

    $ pip install git+https://github.com/niconoe/djangocms-markdown.git#egg=djangocms_markdown

Add ``djangocms_markdown`` and ``markdown_deux`` to your ``INSTALLED_APPS``::

    INSTALLED_APPS = (
        ...,
        'markdown_deux',
        'djangocms_markdown',
    )

Migrate your database::

    ./manage.py migrate djangocms_markdown

Usage
-----

Just go to the page admin of django-cms (or the Entries admin of
cmsplugin-blog) and add a markdown plugin to a placeholder. It should be pretty
much self-explanatory.
